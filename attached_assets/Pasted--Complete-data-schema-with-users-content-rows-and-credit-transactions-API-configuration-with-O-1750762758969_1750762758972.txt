I've implemented the complete ContentScale platform with intelligent pricing system:
✓ Simple pricing structure: Free (1 article), $1 with your API key, $2 with platform API
✓ Smart cost calculation automatically recognizes if user has API key configured
✓ Complete website with landing page, consultation booking, and admin dashboard
✓ All pages connected with proper navigation and routing
✓ Credit system shows exact costs based on API usage (1 or 2 credits per article)
The platform now recognizes whether users have their own API keys and automatically applies the correct pricing. You can navigate between the landing page (/), content writer (/content-writer), consultation (/consultation), and admin panel (/admin) with login credentials admin/admin123.
test the payment system or make any adjustments to the pricing logic?
